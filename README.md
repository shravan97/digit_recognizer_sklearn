## A simple digit recognizer  
First clone the repo and cd into the directory  
You should import the files and functions this way :  
``` from recognizer import digit_rec  
    x = digit_rec(<Your 8x8 numpy array>)
```  
Also make sure that your numpy array is of the form np.array([.,.,  values  .,.,])
